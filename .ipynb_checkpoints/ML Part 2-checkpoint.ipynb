    "Great design, easy interface, excellent documentation, scalability, flexibility, brand equity made it the most popular language; it's production-ready, scalable, and flexible. It runs on Windows, Linux, and MacOS, but also mobile devices like iOS & Android.\n",
    "\n",
    "It includes highly efficient C++ implements of many ML operations, especially those for building neural networks; \n",
    "\n",
    "Comes with a great visualizing tool called TensorBoard to allow us to browse through a graph, learning curves, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has a dedicated team of passionate and helpful developers. One of most popular open source projects on GitHub. \n"
